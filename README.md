# Conway's Game of Life in Rust

Wow, compiled code is _really fast_. This implementation of Life uses a `HashSet` for speedy checks over a sparse "array".

# Getting Started

There are no dependencies beyond the standard library and `cargo`. Simply clone and compile to get started! ðŸš€

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madelyneriksen/life-in-rust .
cargo build --release
```
